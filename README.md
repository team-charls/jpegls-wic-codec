# JPEG-LS Windows Imaging Component Codec

This Windows Imaging Component (WIC) codec makes it possible to decode and encode JPEG-LS (.jls) files with Windows applications that can leverage WIC codecs. It makes it possible to view JPEG-LS encoded images in Windows PhotoViewer, Windows Explorer and import JPEG-LS images in Microsoft Office documents.

## Introduction

The Windows Imaging Component (WIC) is a built-in codec framework of Windows that makes it possible to create independent native image codecs that can be used by a large set of applications. WIC is implemented using COM technology. Image codecs for many popular formats are already pre-installed on Windows.

### Status

This project is the development phase:

- No installer with pre-built binaries is available, manually building and registering is required.

### Supported Operation Systems

The JPEG-LS WIC codec supports the following Windows operating systems:

- Windows 10
- Windows Server 2016

### Applications that can use the JPEG-LS WIC codec

The following application have been validated to work with the JPEG-LS WIC codec:

- Windows Explorer Thumbnail cache. This functionality allows Windows Explorer to show previews of images.
- Windows Photo Viewer.  
 Note: On clean installations of Windows 10 this component is installed but not registered. An Registry file called restore-windows-photo-viewer.reg is provided to restore this functionality. The Registry Editor can be used to add import this .reg file.
- WIC Explorer (sample application from Microsoft). An updated version of this application can be found at <https://github.com/vbaderks/WICExplorer>
- ZackViewer <https://github.com/peirick/ZackViewer>. This viewer can also be used to convert from one image encoding format to another.
- Microsoft Office applications like Word, Excel, Powerpoint. These applications can, when the JPEG-LS codec is installed, import JPEG-LS images in their documents.

#### Windows 10 Microsoft Photos Application not supported

The standard Windows 10 Microsoft Photos application cannot be used at this moment as it is limited to the WIC codecs that are pre-installed on Windows or are provided by Microsoft in the Microsoft Store.
Microsoft currently does not make it possible to create WIC codecs that can be uploaded to the Microsoft Store.

## WIC Codec Identity

The following table provides the codec identification information:

|Property||
|---|---|
|Formal Name|JPEG-LS Format|
|File Name Extension|.jls|
|MIME type| image/jls|
|Specification Support| JPEG-LS (ISO/IEC 14495-1), SPIFF header (ISO/IEC 10918-3)|

The following table lists the GUIDs used to identify the native JPEG-LS codec components:

|Component|Friendly Name|GUID
|---|---|---|
|Container Format|GUID_ContainerFormatJpegLS|52c25458-282d-4ef4-a69f-021bb2984543
|Decoder|CLSID_JpegLSDecoder|e57dc18b-019c-47f2-8ed0-bf587be4ff1b|
|Encoder|CLSID_JpegLSEncoder|70a823ea-009f-402f-9bda-e9b8f6332d61|

The following table lists the pixel formats that can be decoded:

|GUID|Component Count|Bits per Sample
|---|---|---|
|GUID_WICPixelFormat2bppGray|1|2|
